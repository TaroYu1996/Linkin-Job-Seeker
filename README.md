# Linkin-Job-Seeker

`Linkin-Job-Seeker` is a reusable OpenClaw/QClaw skill workspace for monitoring LinkedIn job search results with a **profile-driven** pipeline.

The main skill is:

- `linkedin-job-monitor/`

It supports:

- authenticated LinkedIn job search fetching
- deterministic normalization and filtering
- deduplication against prior runs
- ranking/scoring by profile preferences
- concise internal chat digest output

## Quick Start

### 1) Prepare a profile

Use `scripts/config_schema.py` + `scripts/collect_profile.py` to build or update a profile object:

- Required:
  - `search_url`
  - `target_roles`
  - `regions`
  - `allowed_location_types`
- Optional:
  - salary constraints
  - seniority
  - title/JD keyword constraints
  - company allow/deny lists
  - digest and scheduling controls

### 2) Provide an authenticated LinkedIn session adapter

`scripts/fetch_linkedin_jobs.py` defines `LinkedInSessionAdapter` protocol.  
Plug in your runtime implementation (Playwright/Selenium/hosted browser session).

### 3) Run the monitor pipeline

Call `run_monitor(...)` from `scripts/run_monitor.py`:

1. fetch
2. normalize
3. filter
4. dedupe
5. score
6. summarize

---

## Development Notes

- Filtering and ranking are profile-driven (avoid hardcoded role logic).
- Keep runtime-specific browser behavior inside the fetch layer.
- Persist profile state and dedupe state externally (JSON, DB, KV, etc.).
- For user testing, use the bilingual first-time chat script in `linkedin-job-monitor/references/first-time-conversation-template.md`.

---

## Validation

You can run basic script validation with:

```bash
python -m compileall linkedin-job-monitor/scripts
```
